Command Line to start:
    1)  $make
    2)  $make server (default setting: port-1234 thread number-10)
    3)  $./test-scalability.sh $1 $2 $3  
        //start client
        // $1 $2 $3 are the command-line arguments
        // $1 is the number of client per machine
        // $2 is the host that server runs on
        // $3 is addtional info print by client (-i)
        /* the test-scalability.sh must use with file named machinelist */
    4)  $./stop-clients.sh
    
Release:
    1)  Multiple-Clients communicating with Server
    2)  Server handle messages and send feedback to Clients
    
Potential Improvements:
    1)  Server could only hold upto around 350 clients at one time
    2)  Server could only handle upto around 1250 messages/s at one time
    3)  Server performance fluctuates greatly when messages rate are high
    4)  Client output numbers are slightly different from expected
    
Author Words:
    1)  The program works prefectly in lab machine
    2)  There could be some problems under tiny possibilities
    3)  The program is based on the A2 requirements
    4)  Contact with Author if there are some unexpected problems
    5)  Thanks for your work and patience.
